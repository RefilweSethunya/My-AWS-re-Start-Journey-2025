## Takeaways
While it can be logistically challenging to keep all the operating system (OS) and application software up to date. In most cases, OS updates can be automatically applied via the network. In AWS we use Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create a patch baseline. And then use the same patch baseline that you created to scan the resources for COMPLIANCE. And then also use the same patch baseline to patch the resources (e.g EC2 Linux instances).
