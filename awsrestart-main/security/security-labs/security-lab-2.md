# Security Lab: Systems-Hardening

## Objective
Strengthen system security through patch management. Specifically, the tasks include: patching Linux instances using the default patch baseline; creating a custom patch baseline tailored to specific requirements.; using patch groups to apply the custom patch baseline to Windows instances; and verifying patch compliance to ensure systems meet security and update standards.

## Takeaways
Keeping operating systems (OS) and application software up to date can be logistically challenging, but most OS updates can be automatically applied over the network. In AWS, Patch Manager (a capability of AWS Systems Manager) simplifies this process by allowing one to create patch baselines, scan resources for compliance, and apply patches to instances such as EC2 Linux or Windows servers. This ensures systems remain secure, compliant, and consistently hardened against vulnerabilities.
