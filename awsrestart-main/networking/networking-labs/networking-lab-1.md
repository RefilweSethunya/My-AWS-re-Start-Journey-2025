Under the Networking tab(Instance A), I note the Public IPv4 address is missing and Private IPv4 address exists.

Under the Networking tab(Instance B), I note the Public and Private IPv4 addresses are both present.

We therefore, cannot connect to Instance A without a public IPv4 or v6 address assigned.

## Takeaways
An EC2 instance (instance A) needs a public IP address to connect to the internet. Private IP addresses are used only within the VPC and cannot establish a connection to the internet.
