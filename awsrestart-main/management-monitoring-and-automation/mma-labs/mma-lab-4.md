# Management, Monitoring and Automation Lab: Managing resources with Tagging

## Objective
This lab focuses on using Amazon EC2 instance tags to automate management tasks.<br>The AWS CLI is used to inspect and update tags, run scripts to start and stop instances, and apply JMESPath queries for filtering. The challenge extends this by designing a way to terminate instances missing required tags, reinforcing how tagging supports automation and governance.
