# Compute Lab: Scale and Load Balance your Architecture
## Objective
The objective of this lab is to implement Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to build a fault-tolerant and scalable infrastructure. I created an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an EC2 instance, configured a load balancer, and set up a launch template with an Auto Scaling group. I then configured the Auto Scaling group to scale new instances within private subnets and used Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor the performance and health of the infrastructure.

## Takeaways
This lab showed me how ELB and Auto Scaling work together to improve reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency. By creating an AMI, configuring a load balancer, and setting up an Auto Scaling group with CloudWatch alarms, I reinforced the importance of automation in maintaining performance while minimizing manual intervention.
