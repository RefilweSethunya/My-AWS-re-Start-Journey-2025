# Compute Lab: Working with AWS Lambda

## Objective
Deploy and configure a serverless computing solution using AWS Lambda. Identify the necessary IAM policy permissions that allow Lambda functions to interact with other AWS resources, create a Lambda layer to address external library dependencies, and configure Lambda functions that extract data from a database and send reports to users. Then deploy and test a scheduled Lambda function that invokes another function, and finally, use CloudWatch Logs to troubleshoot and validate the solution.

## Takeaways
This lab demonstrated how AWS Lambda can be used to build a serverless reporting solution. By configuring IAM permissions, Lambda layers, scheduled triggers, and CloudWatch Logs, I see how serverless architecture enables automated, reliable, and scalable workflows without managing infrastructure.
