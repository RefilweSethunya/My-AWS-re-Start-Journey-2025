- Concatenate strings
- Use the string to get input
- Format strings for output


## Steps Taken
1. Logged into AWS Management Console
2. Services > Cloud9 > reStart-python-cloud9 card > Selected it and opened IDE
3. Created Python Exercise File
   - In the AWS Cloud9 IDE, File > New From Template > Python File.
   - File > Save As > StringDataType.py
4. Started the terminal shell
   - In the AWS Cloud9 IDE > Selected the (+) icon > New Terminal
   - Displayed the present working directory and located StringDataType.py file:
     ``` bash
     pwd
     ```
5. Introducing the string data type
   - From the navigation pane of the IDE selected the StringDataType.py file
   - In the file entered the code:
      ``` python
      myString = "This is a string."
      print(myString)
      ```
   - Save > Run
   - Extended the Python script by using the built-in function type() to get the data type of the variable:
