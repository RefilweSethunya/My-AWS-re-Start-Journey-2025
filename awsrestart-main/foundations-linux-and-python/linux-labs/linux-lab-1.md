Amazon Linux 2 is the **LATEST** Linux operating system that AWS offers. It is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance runtime environment for applications that run on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
It is an Enterprise-class Linux distribution derived from RHEL and designed for use on AWS virtual machines

## Objective
Use SSH to access an Amazon Linux AMI within Vocareum labs
and understand the purpose of the man command.

## Steps Taken
1. Logged into AWS Console
2. Launched EC2 instance (Ubuntu)
3. Use SSH to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance
4. Explore the Linux man pages
   - To open the manual pages for the man program, enter the following command in the PuTTY terminal window, and press Enter:
   - ```bash

## Takeaways
This lab reinforces my knowledge of the basic command line interface functionality and provides a solid foundation from which I can continue to learn about new commands and capabilities within the Linux shell.
