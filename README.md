  - Connected to Amazon Polly for text-to-speech output.  
  - Deployed on AWS Amplify for user testing
- [View Project](/awsrestart-main/projects/project-2/README.md)

### Event Announcement System
- **Goal:** Develop an event notification system to send automated alerts and reminders to registered users via email and SMS.
- **Highlights:**
  - Static frontend hosted in Amazon S3 with API endpoints exposed via Amazon API Gateway.  
  - Two AWS Lambda functions â€” one to manage user subscriptions, another to handle event registration and JSON updates.  
  - Events stored in an S3 bucket as JSON files for simplicity and durability.  
  - Email notifications managed via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).  
  - Fully serverless, cost-efficient, and scalable architecture for event-driven communication.   
- [View Project](/awsrestart-main/projects/project-3/README.md)

### Medical Care System
- **Goal:** Implement a cloud-based healthcare management solution for secure patient data handling and appointment tracking.
- **Highlights:**
  - Configured an EC2 launch template with Auto Scaling Groups across multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance.  
  - Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic and monitor instance health.  
  - Integrated Amazon Cognito for user authentication and role-based access control (doctors, patients, and admins).  
  - Deployed a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS database for continuous availability and failover resilience.  
  - Configured Route 53 with health checks and failover routing for DNS-level reliability.  
  - Added Amazon EFS for scalable, shared file storage across EC2 instances.  
  - Designed to maintain uptime, data integrity, and security compliance in a healthcare environment.

## Reflections

As I near the end of my AWS re/Start journey, Iâ€™m struck by how much Iâ€™ve grown. I started with lots of curiosity and week by week, the program built up my Linux and networking basic skills to databases, security and automation. The hands-on labs made cloud concepts tangible and boosted my confidence.

Another big milestone was using GitHub for the first time. After working with version control, I see how powerful it is for tracking progress and working in a structured, professional way.

Where I focused on individual services before, now I see the bigger picture of how each AWS service connects to build scalable, reliable systems. Beyond technical skills, Iâ€™ve gained perseverance, problem-solving and the confidence to think like a cloud practitioner.
