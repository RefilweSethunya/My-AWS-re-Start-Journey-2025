## Reflections

As I near the end of my AWS re/Start journey, Iâ€™m struck by how much Iâ€™ve grown. I started with lots of curiosity and week by week, the program built up my Linux and networking basic skills to databases, security and automation. The hands-on labs made cloud concepts tangible and boosted my confidence.

Another big milestone was using GitHub for the first time. After working with version control, I see how powerful it is for tracking progress and working in a structured, professional way.

Where I focused on individual services before, now I see the bigger picture of how each AWS service connects to build scalable, reliable systems. Beyond technical skills, Iâ€™ve gained perseverance, problem-solving and the confidence to think like a cloud practitioner.
